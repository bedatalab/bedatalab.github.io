 </p>
<h3 id="miguel-alcantar">Miguel Alcantar</h3>
<p>Miguel is a Biological Engineering Ph.D. student in Prof. James J. Collins’ lab at MIT. After a 17-year stint in Los Angeles, Miguel moved south and received a Bachelor of Science in Bioengineering from the University of California San Diego –known for its lack of snow. Although Miguel immersed himself in fully computational research during his undergraduate years, he made the dangerous and time-consuming mistake of exploring the experimental world when he arrived at MIT. His research now focuses on developing computational and experimental tools for engineering synthetic probiotics. Outside of lab Miguel enjoys drinking smoothies, biking and hiking distances he is physically unprepared for, and playing basketball with others at a similarly low skill level.</p>

 </p>
<h3 id="dan-anderson">Dan Anderson</h3>
<p>Dan Anderson is a 5th-year PhD student in Christopher Voigt’s group. Prior to being at MIT, Dan took a mere 7 years to acquire a B.A. in Molecular and Cell Biology from UC Berkeley: 4 years spent at various community colleges, 1-year crewing sailboats in the South Pacific, and 2 years at UC Berkeley. His current research focuses on high-throughput molecular diversity generation and screening methods. Dan is a self-taught programmer who enjoys integrating coding with a variety of his laboratory workflows. This passion is demonstrated by the fact that he frequently spends hours automating processes that would take minutes to do manually. Outside of lab, he enjoys participating in a variety of outdoor activities such as climbing, hiking, and backcountry skiing through the MIT Outing Club (MITOC).</p>

<h3 id="pablo-cárdenas">Pablo Cárdenas</h3>
<p>A native of Bogotá, Colombia, Pablo spent his undergrad at Universidad de Los Andes grappling with the frustrations of experimental and field research, and finding refuge in theoretical and computational biology. After majoring in biological sciences with a minor in bioinformatics, he left Bogotá and ascertained that experiments fail in labs on every continent and of every budget. Resigned to his fate, he came to MIT as a Biological Engineering PhD student in 2018 to join Jacquin Niles&rsquo;s lab, known as a quality malaria wet lab more than as a dry lab. Throughout his tenure there, he hopes to change the latter without setting fire to the former. Besides developing molecular and computational tools for malaria research, Pablo served as TA for 20.420 (Principles of Biomolecular Engineering), is a peer conflict coach with the BE REFS, and spends time playing way more musical instruments than he can ever realistically be good at.</p>

<h3 id="patrick-holec">Patrick Holec</h3>
<p>Patrick is a mathematician facing an identity crisis as a PhD student in the biological engineering department. He received a BS in mathematics and biomedical engineering from the University of Minnesota and still remains intensely loyal to his home state. Currently, he works for Michael Birnbaum, developing new technologies to sequence immune repertoires that rely on probabilistic methods to improve scalability. In his free time, you can catch Patrick on almost every BE intramural sports team, in the ceramics studio, or designing his own board games.</p>

<h3 id="maxine-jonas">Maxine Jonas</h3>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Current students in Dr. Jonas&rsquo;s class are not permitted to make appointments with her to review assignments for that class.</p>
<p>Dr. Maxine Jonas is an instructor in the Department of Biological Engineering, and one of its alumnae. After undergraduate studies at École Polytechnique in France, Maxine completed in 2006 her PhD in BE under the mentorship of Prof. Peter So. She then embarked on working in the biotech industry in the Boston area, both in start-up and in large company environments, forseven years prior to returning to MIT campus. Maxine’s interests include biological imaging, biophysics, neurotechnology, computational modeling, drug metabolism, and education. She currently teaches lab-focused courses (20.109, 20.203, 20.309, 20.381), lecture-instructed classes (20.310, 20.430), and first-year exploratory seminars (SP.247). Maxine has particularly enjoyed meeting a wide cross-section of BE scholars since she joined the Communication Lab in 2014 and the Data and Coding Lab in 2020. Outside of troubleshooting mutagenesis plasmids or realigning students’ microscopes, Maxine loves theater plays, in books or live, daydreaming in museums, and loves water: swimming, sailing, riding her bike in the rain, skiing on the northeastern ha’d-packed or in the spring slush, skydiving through clouds, and drinking bubbly water.</p>

 </p>
<h3 id="meelim-lee">Meelim Lee</h3>
<p>Meelim is a BE PhD student in Doug Lauffenburger’s lab where her research applies systems techniques towards better understanding the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s Disease. Specifically, she leverages statistical modeling to combine omics data from mouse models and patient samples and applies mechanistic modeling towards characterizing temporal aspects of intracellular signaling using MATLAB. During graduate school, Meelim has also served as a TA for 20.320 (Analysis of Biomolecular and Cellular Systems) and spent a summer interning with a Quantitative Systems Pharmacology group. Meelim also enjoys carefully following protocols as a baker, learning about models for non-biological applications, playing tennis, reading economics and fiction, improving as a runner, and taking care of her growing collection of plants</p>

<h3 id="krista-pullen">Krista Pullen</h3>
<p>After spending her childhood running around rural Connecticut, Krista studied applied mathematics and biology/bioengineering at Stony Brook University. While her undergraduate research focused on the biomechanics of walking gait, her systems biology courses inspired her to take a dive into molecular and pathway biology. She was a research technician at Tufts, studying the stress response of mycobacteria, before she started her BE PhD journey in 2018. As a member of the Lauffenburger lab, Krista spends a lot of time thinking (&amp; coding!) about how to identify immune correlates of infectious disease by applying systems serology and machine learning to pre-clinical and clinical vaccine data across various species. When away from her desk, Krista loves to spend time running, cooking and adoring the many cute dogs of Cambridge.</p>
