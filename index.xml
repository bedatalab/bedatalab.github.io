      <description>The MIT BE Data Lab provides peer coaching on data analysis and coding for life sciences researchers and students at MIT.  Inspired by the BE Comm Lab&amp;lsquo;s mode of operation, we provide on-demand, discipline-specific, one-on-one coaching to help students and researchers plan and carry out computational projects.
We provide support for the following specific languages and frameworks:  Python (numpy, pandas, sklearn, &amp;hellip;) R - (RNAseq data analysis) MATLAB Git (through GitHub) Bash/UNIX Java COMSOL (through external members)  We also provide support for the following courses:  20.</description>

      <description>Fellows  Dan Anderson Dan Anderson is a 5th-year PhD student in Christopher Voigt’s group. Prior to being at MIT, Dan took a mere 7 years to acquire a B.A. in Molecular and Cell Biology from UC Berkeley: 4 years spent at various community colleges, 1-year crewing sailboats in the South Pacific, and 2 years at UC Berkeley. His current research focuses on high-throughput molecular diversity generation and screening methods. Dan is a self-taught programmer who enjoys integrating coding with a variety of his laboratory workflows.</description>

      <description>What do you support? We can help you in two broad areas. 1) To understand classwork and get through problem sets. We know that learning coding syntax and problem solving is not easy and while we will not give you all the answers, we hope to provide additional guidance. 2) We will provide brainstorming support for the code you are working on - what are ways to use computation to inform your experimental design, what is an efficient way to analyze data, what processes are used for high-throughput &amp;lsquo;omics analyses.</description>

      <description>Appointments are scheduled through the BE Comm Lab&amp;rsquo;s online scheduler&amp;ndash;thanks BE Comm Lab!
Make sure you select the coding calendar from the dropdown at the top of the page.
Appointments will be exclusively online until further notice from MIT.
Although we&amp;rsquo;re happy to provide support COMSOL if necessary, please reach out to Prerna Bhargava to schedule for this software only.
You can also find us on slack to ask questions and share resources.</description>
